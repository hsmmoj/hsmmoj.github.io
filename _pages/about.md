I am a Ph.D. student in the department of [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.ucsd.edu/) at the University of California San Diego, where I am working under the supervision of [Prof. Yang Zheng](https://zhengy09.github.io/index.html) in [Scalable Optimization and Control (SOC) Lab](https://zhengy09.github.io/soclab.html). Before starting my Ph.D. program at UCSD, I was an undergraduate in the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Tehran. I received my bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering with a minor degree in Computer Engineering. I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Hamed Kebraei](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=eDseLNYAAAAJ&hl=en) during my undergrad studies. 


Research Interests
======

My main areas of interest lie in reinforcement learning, robotics, optimization, and machine learning. With the recent surge in the development of large language models, my focus has shifted towards exploring avenues for creating AI agents that are not only efficient but also trustworthy and safety-conscious. This involves delving into the ethical implications of AI, developing robust frameworks for AI safety, and ensuring that AI systems can make decisions that align with human values and ethical standards. The goal is to integrate these advanced technologies in a way that they augment human capabilities without compromising on safety or ethical considerations.
