I am a Ph.D. student in the department of [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.ucsd.edu/) at the University of California San Diego, where I am working under the supervision of [Prof. Yang Zheng](https://zhengy09.github.io/index.html) in [Scalable Optimization and Control (SOC) Lab](https://zhengy09.github.io/soclab.html). Before starting my Ph.D. program at UCSD, I was an undergraduate in the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Tehran. I received my bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering with a minor degree in Computer Engineering. I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Hamed Kebraei](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=eDseLNYAAAAJ&hl=en) during my undergrad studies. 


Research Interests
======
I am primarily interested in optimization, control, and machine learning, especially in large-scale settings. In recent years, analysis and control of large-scale dynamical systems have attracted much attention since systems are becoming increasingly complex. Designing efficient and reliable algorithms for solving such large systems without the need for unachievably significant computational recourses is a crucial step. I want to put my effort into tackling some of the practical problems in this area. Furthermore, I am interested in reinforcement learning and its applications in connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs).
